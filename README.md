I first understood the requirement and decided to create a simple but realistic dynamic web page. I planned the basic layout in my mind (header, product cards, and footer) before writing any code.

I kept the data separate in a JSON array so the content is not hard-coded and can be easily changed or fetched from an API later. Using JavaScript, I dynamically rendered the cards on the page and added basic functionality like search and button interaction.

While writing CSS, I focused on clean spacing, readability, and a professional look rather than over-designing. Overall, I followed a structured and practical approach similar to how real projects are built.
